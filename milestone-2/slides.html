        <li>Freemium,Prosumer, and Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Freemium: Free video distribution, with advanced options avaiable upon payment(s).  Usually users are moreso consumers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prosumer: Peer-to-peer video sharing, where users both create and view video.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Saas: I am referring to the software that are only avaiable upon payment or subscription to the service.</li>

    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>The "cable provider" of today is the <b>video platform</b>.  It is a distributor of digital video.</li>
        <section>
          <pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">"The technology for interactive home video entertainment has been 
actively developing.  Hybrid networks that enable multi-media connections are being 
studied as a step toward all-digital video networks." (Bar-Noy)
          </pre>
        </section>
		<section>
		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">"The movies are stored in a central video server, which may be connected 
to other servers over a high bandwidth WAN. The video server is connected by a high
capacity fi􏰀ber link to local distribution centers/hubs." (Bar-Noy)

	<ul>
        <li> <b>Infomediary </b> is a synthesis word derviing from "information" and "intermediary".  Infomediary is a roadmap guiding people through the "information Internet" possibilities.</li>
		<br>
		<section>
		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">"An infomediary is a new Internet business model that applies to firms 
that help customers deal more efficiently and effectively with online vendors. In 
e-commerce, it functions as a third-party provider of unbiased information and as a 
business matchmaker. An infomediary also provides vendors with consumer information 
to help them focus on products and services customers want.  Thanks to the Internet, 
there's no longer any such thing as a limited selection.  Whether you're shopping for 
a house or a car or a loan to help pay for them, you can point and click through 
hundreds of Web sites to find a product or service that suits your needs.  
But who has the time?" (King)

	<article>
		<ul>
        <li><b>Intermediary</b> is middle link in a value chain.  An intermediate step between a user desiring to view a video, and watching a video.  In the "category" mind map I've used the term <b>reintermediary</b> because these intermediaries are additional links in the digital age.  However either intermediary or reintermediary describe the same category.</li>
		</ul>
	  		<section>
	  		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">"An intermediary, also called a middleman or broker in the research 
literature in various fields, implies the entry of a new company into the value chain 
that connects buyers and suppliers, either as a provider of new and innovative services 
[3, 18], or as a competitor to existing intermediaries [8].
Electronic marketplaces require price setting, transaction processing and coordination, 
inventory management, immediacy, quality guarantees and monitoring [17]. With the 
appropriate motivation and profit opportunities, any industrial player, such as a buyer, 
a supplier or an IT vendor, can become a provider of an online market [4].
Bailey and Bakos [2] emphasize the need for intermediation in electronic marketplaces. 
They report that IT-mediated markets still need aggregator for one-stop shopping window, 
trust providers, information exchange facilitators and information filtering brokers."

      <h2>Categories</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>There isn't dotted red lines in the catgories animation.  Instead Instagram and Vine moves around from video platform, to intermediary, and to Social Media.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Instagram and Vine can be utilized in multiple capacities.  They can be used to post videos (video platform), to be a intermediary video of another video, or they can be used to promote and socialize.</li>
		<section>
		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">"Prosumers are absolutely in the content business, but rather than 
create it, they’re more like content harvesters—curators perhaps, 
even content moderators.  They’re merchants of conversation." (Jaffe page 48)
		</pre>
		</section>		
        <li>I have included Hot Potato, my major research project, in the intermediary video category.  Hot Potato would act in a similar fashion to Vine and Instagram.  Hot Potato can be the end video, or it could lead to watch the full video thus being an intermediary, or be used as user generated content to promote the full video.</li>

      <h2>Technical Means</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>Platform has already been defined, a prosumer platform is a platform that offer prosumer activity.  These category makes differentiation between the "average person's" production with business production</li>
        <br>
        <li>On the other end of the spectrum is the business content mangement system (CMS).  Business video CMS is another type of platform, most likely classfiable as a SaaS.  A CMS is a essentially a cloud storage platform with flexible distribution parameters.  Videos can be stored (hosted) whilst controlling access.  Video CMS allows for content distributioned to be selectively chosen.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The "picture frame" in which an Internet user is viewing the "motion picture" is a web video player.  Web video players play videos on an Internet browser.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The "picture frame" in which a digital video is viewed is an home video players.  Home video players play videos on a online or offline computer.</li>
        
      </ul>

    <hgroup>
      <h2>Technical Means</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
	<ul>
		<li>Video CMS platform is an extension of the traditional producer to consumer relationship.  Video CMS have their own controlled video players.  Prosumer platforms, web video players, and home video players are a part of the new wave of Internet video.</li>
		<section>
		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">
"Generation i is also helping us understand more about what it will 
require to connect and resonate with a new creative class who, for the most part, are 
disinterested in the wares we’re peddling. They’re still eating, sleeping, flying, 
renting, driving, investing, cleaning, hosting, medicating, and entertaining . . . 
Only the way they get to the point where they’re armed with the goods and services 
they need to go on their merry way is fundamentally different compared to 50, 20, 10, 
or even 5 years ago." (Jaffe page 38)
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">
"Said prosumers are demonstrating a new behavior 
trait that extends beyond the production benefit. It is the second distinction between 
prosumers and consumers—namely, being proactive, volunteering information, value, 
ideas, help, support and the like." (Jaffe page 50)</pre>

      <h2>Home Versus Web Video Players</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple TV is a not a web player, but it is a home video player</li>
        <br>
        <li>JW Player plays videos within a web browser, but it is not an offline home player for digital video</li>
        <br>
        <li>Most of the web players listed are built on Adobe Flash</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prosumer and video CMS players often have their own players, built on either Adobe Flash or HTML5.</li>

      <h2>Technical Means Connectivity</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>The technical means mind map doesn't have red dotted lines.  These means of access are isolated currently. More crossover with technical means will likely happen in the future.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Web players and home players will crossover.  Prosumer platforms and players will crossover.  CMS is uncertain, becuase of its control aspect.</li>

      <h2>Short Format and Long Format Video</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul> 
        <li>The length format mind map is similarly fashioned as the "Technical Means Connectivity" slide.</li>
        
		<li>Instagram videos are 12 seconds limit, Vine videos are 6.5 seconds limit.</li>
        
        <li>Freemium Vimeo has a file size limit, SaaS Vimeo Plus and Pro is much less file size resistrictve.</li>
        
        <li>YouTube is essentially free at nominal file size and video length.  To be specific: "when you first sign up with YouTube, your account will be limited to videos under 15 minutes, until the account has been 'verified.'  Once 'verified,' you can post any video that doesn’t exceed 20GB." (Mini Matters)</li>
        
        <li>However, the average video length is not nearly as short as Instagram or Vine.</li>
			
		<li>Hot Potato is a crossover platform between short format video viewing, like Vine, and long format video.  Because Hot Potato is an editor, it can modifiy a video to whichever length:4 mintues, 1 minute, or 6 seconds.</li>

"The average video length [in the Mini Matters study] was 
4 minutes and 20 seconds. ComScore reported that in January the duration of the 
average online content video was 4.4 minutes." (Mini Matters)

"A typical video on YouTube is around 3 to 5 minutes long, illustrating that 
short videos are the norm [Cheng et al. 2008; Gill et al. 2007]" (Mitra)</pre>
		</section>
		<li>Video uploading process is also involved with the type of user activity and video length</li>
		<section>
		<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="Reference">
"In general, we find that active contribution, such as video uploading 
and rating of videos, is much less prevalent than passive use." (Mitra)

"Here we find that a significant number of uploaders uploaded only one video. In the 
Yahoo! video dataset, approximately 67% of the uploaders uploaded only once, whereas 
for Dailymotion, Metacafe, and Veoh the corresponding percentages are approximately 
47%, 44%, and 35%, respectively. In general, from this figure we observe that most, 
approximately 95% or more, of the uploaders uploaded less than 50 videos." (Mitra)</pre>
